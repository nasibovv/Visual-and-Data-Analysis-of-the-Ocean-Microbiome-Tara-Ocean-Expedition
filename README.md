# Visual-and-Data-Analysis-of-the-Ocean-Microbiome-Tara-Ocean-Expedition

Visual and Data Analysis of the Ocean Microbiome – Tara Ocean Expedition (February 2024 – March 2024 | Newcastle, England)

• Developed an interactive visualization tool to analyze marine microbial diversity and distribution
from the Tara Ocean Expedition, utilizing high-dimensional data of 35,650 Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) collected globally.

• Enhanced the comprehension of microbial abundance patterns linked to environmental metadata,
allowing bioscience experts to explore ecological interactions and regional biodiversity
variations.

• Applied principles of data visualization and accessibility in designing multiple coordinated
views, optimizing user engagement and ensuring inclusivity in data interpretation.
